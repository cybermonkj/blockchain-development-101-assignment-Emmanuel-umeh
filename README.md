This is a simple decentralized application created using ReactJs and Ethereum that allows users to buy and sell products on the platform.

To use you need to have metamask wallet extension installed on your chrome browser and test funds in it.

It is deployed on the Kovan Test network. Please migrate to to that network to use the dapp.


After adding or purchasing a product, please ensure you reload the browser to see the changes.

Also if you own a product you will be unable to buy your own product.
